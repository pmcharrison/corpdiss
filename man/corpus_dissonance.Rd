\title{Corpus dissonance}
\usage{
corpus_dissonance(x, table = corpdiss::popular_1_pc_chord_type)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Sonority to analyse.
This should be an object created by the \code{hrep} package,
representing a pitch chord (\code{\link[hrep]{pi_chord}}),
representing a pitch-class chord (\code{\link[hrep]{pc_chord}}),
representing a pitch-class chord type (\code{\link[hrep]{pc_chord_type}}),
or a pitch-class set (\code{\link[hrep]{pc_set}}).
This object will be coerced to the same type as the corpus dissonance table,
i.e. \code{type(table)}.}

\item{table}{Corpus dissonance table, as created by
\code{\link{corpus_dissonance_table}()}.
This table summarises chord prevalences within a corpus.
The default is \code{\link{popular_1_pc_chord_type}}.}
}
\value{
Dissonance estimate, as a numeric scalar.
}
\description{
Calculates a corpus-based estimate of the dissonance of a sonority.
}
\details{
By default, dissonance is estimated from chord prevalences
in the McGill Billboard dataset \insertCite{Burgoyne2011}{hcorp}.
The dataset's contents were sampled from the Billboard magazine's
United States "Hot 100" chart between 1958 and 1991,
and transcribed by expert musicians.
See \code{\link[hcorp]{popular_1}} for more details.

By default,
the dissonance estimation treats chords as transposition invariant,
and chord pitches as octave-invariant,
but differentiates between different inversions of the same chord.
Different behaviour can be achieved by passing a custom corpus analysis
to the \code{table} argument.
